###Kunal Palawat

My name is Kunal Palawat. I am a senior in the Rubenstein School studying Environmental Science. I have a concentration in Agriculture and the Environment. I also have a minor in soil science and plant biology. Basically, I love dirt and plants. I work in Carol Adair's lab: Terrestrial Biogeochemistry for a Changing World. I study all things soil microorganism including litter decomposition in forests and nutrient cycling in agricultural riparian zones.

My interests lie in plant root and soil interactions, microbial biogeochemical cycling, and crop science. I also have a desire to incorporate social justice and equity into my research and research outcomes.
