#Introduction 

##Introduction
- Riparian zones are integral to managing biogeochemical cycling

\bigskip

- They can reduce the flow of nutrients such as Phosphorus, Carbon, and Nitrogen into waterways

#Study Site & Sampling Scheme

##Study Site & Sampling Scheme
>- \color{red} We took 90 intact soil cores from a wet agricultural riparian zone in Swanton, VT
>- \color{gray} Wihin the wet riparian zone, we took 45 cores from the dry site and 45 cores from the wet site
>- \color{gray} Future studies will sample from the dry agricultural riparian zone and a wet/dry forested riparian zone in Northern VT

#Methods

##Incubation Protocol
>- The first 15 cores from each site were kept dry
>- An average Swanton rainstorm was simulated on the second 15 cores from each site 
>- Hurricane Irene was simulated on the last 15 cores from each site

##Incubation Protocol (cont.)
>- Gas flux data measured via photoacoustic spectroscopy
>- Leachate was collected, labeled, and frozen as needed for future analysis
>- Cores were destructively sampled for future enzyme analysis

##Post-Incubation Analysis
>- Microplating leachate to assess ammonium and nitrate concentrations
>- Running leachate samples to assess dissolved organic carbon and dissolved nitrogen
>- Microplating soils to assess microbial enzymatic activity
