Question 1
Use the code from class as a template and analyze a function of your choosing that is relevant to your own research. Do not change any of the functions in the class code. Instead, copy and rename functions for your own project. Edit those copies, and then modify the lines of code in the main body of your program to call the new functions. If you do this carefully, you will be able to take full advantage of the existing program, but adapt it for your specific use.
